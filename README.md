## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

- The `preview.png` file is a placeholder for an image preview of your Wikipedia Search Page. Replace it with an actual screenshot or preview of your project.
- Ensure you have the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) in your project folder.

This README serves as a starting point, and you can tailor it to match the specifics of your project as it evolves.
